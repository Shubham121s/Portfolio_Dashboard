A dynamic portfolio dashboard built with **Next.js (React framework)** and **Node.js**, designed to provide real-time insights into stock portfolio performance. The app fetches stock market data (Current Market Price, P/E Ratio, Latest Earnings, etc.) from external APIs like Yahoo Finance and Google Finance, processes it, and displays it in an interactive, visually appealing dashboard.

  * [`yahoo-finance2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yahoo-finance2)

### Google Finance API (P/E Ratio & Earnings)

* Requires scraping/unofficial solutions.
* Example: Puppeteer or unofficial finance libraries.
